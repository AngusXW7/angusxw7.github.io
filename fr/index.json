First of all I would like to thank you for coming to my blog, this is my first attempt to build a blog and edit posts on it with makedown syntax, I hope that here you can witness my growth and my change. I hope you can join me in witnessing the process of building this blog from zero to one, from nothing to something. After half a month of preparation I finally got the infrastructure of the site all set up. I was going to send this post out on the 1st of March as the start of the month and the start of this site, which must have been a great day. It’s a pity that I’m so busy that I’ve just made some time to write this blog. I didn’t know what to call this document when I first created it and what to write about it, haha. After all, I rarely write and share things, so I’m suddenly a little bit baffled. As a programmer, I’m sure everyone starts with a “Hello World! and hopefully there will be no ‘break’ or ‘sleep’ in between. My initial idea for the content of the blog is to divide it into three main sections: Unreal Engine Game Creation, C++ Life and General, because after all, we come from a background of game software programming, learning C++ and Unreal Engine, and when we first come to an unfamiliar field, we must start with something we are familiar with in order to produce content more easily. Of course, if I find something interesting, it will be added to my blog as a new section. Well, that’s all for now, I’ve got to get busy. If you are interested in me and would like to know more about me, you can check out my profile by clicking on “About XW7\u0026” in the top right corner. I’m sure my profile will continue to be updated, after all, people are growing up, and my experience, abilities and work will get richer and richer as time goes by.
