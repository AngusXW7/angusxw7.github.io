Hello, I’ve found time in my busy schedule to come back as promised. Today, I’ll talk about pointers. It’s said that the essence of C is pointers, but it’s also true that C should be one of the few high-level languages that can manipulate the underlying memory with pointers. I’m sure my understanding is not as deep as that of the top coders, after all, I’m just a beginner, the wording is not accurate or logic is not strict, please enlighten me ~, if there is where to say the wrong, also welcome to point out!

We often say that a pointer is an address, and that a pointer variable is a variable used to store a memory address. As I understand it, a pointer is synonymous with your home, and a memory address is where your home actually is. When you say that a pointer points to such and such address, you are actually saying that your home is a synonym for where your home address is (that is, where your home lives). This sounds a bit like nonsense.

Next, let’s say I want to invite my friend to my house for the weekend, then I just say ptr to them and they surely can’t know where my house is for no reason, right? So we’ll use “\u0026” for the address, so int* ptr = \u0026 XW7’s home now becomes ptr = 12 City 34 56th Street 78 , the actual address of my house, and again, we read “=” as “is”, XW7’s home is 78-56th street, 34th district, 12th city. This way my friends can find my house without any problem on weekends.

We will only see int* variable name = something; or *ptr = something; char* c ; //char type pointer int* i ; //int type pointer float* f ; //float type pointer In general, if it follows a data type, like char int float, then it represents a pointer to that type char* is a pointer to a char type; int* is a int type pointer; float* is a float pointer; and so on // on 32-bit systems, all pointers are 4 bytes in size. *ptr = XW7 home ; ptr = 0X12345678; But if it’s followed by a variable name, like *ptr above, then it’s a dereference, and you have to use a pronoun. In layman’s terms, adding * to ptr means that ptr is encrypted and can only say XW7’s home, but not the exact address of 12 City 34, 56th Street, 78. That is, *ptr = XW7’s home , *ptr is XW7’s home.

If you want more than one pointer or value that cannot be changed, you have to use more than one const, e.g. const int* const ptr; // both int* and ptr are immutable const int* const p1, const p2; // int* p1 p2 are immutable ","date":"2022-03-09","objectID":"/fr/c_pointer/:2:1","tags":["Pointer","C++","essence"],"title":"C++ Pointer","uri":"/fr/c_pointer/"},{"categories":["C++"],"content":"APPLICATIONS So after we know who is not changeable, what do we use them for; first we can get two more useful information from the naming statement, one is who the pointer points to, and the other is what the pointing thing contains. Let’s use the example of renting a house, where the pointer represents the house and the content inside represents the tenant. If what is pointed to cannot be changed, then it is now the landlord identity, that is, as long as it is my house, it does not matter which tenants, you can change them at will. If the content of the pointer cannot be changed, then it is now the identity of the tenant, that is to say, as long as I am renting the house, it does not matter which house, you can change it at will.

First of all I would like to thank you for coming to my blog, this is my first attempt to build a blog and edit posts on it with makedown syntax, I hope that here you can witness my growth and my change. I hope you can join me in witnessing the process of building this blog from zero to one, from nothing to something. After half a month of preparation I finally got the infrastructure of the site all set up. I was going to send this post out on the 1st of March as the start of the month and the start of this site, which must have been a great day. It’s a pity that I’m so busy that I’ve just made some time to write this blog. I didn’t know what to call this document when I first created it and what to write about it, haha. After all, I rarely write and share things, so I’m suddenly a little bit baffled. As a programmer, I’m sure everyone starts with a “Hello World! and hopefully there will be no ‘break’ or ‘sleep’ in between. My initial idea for the content of the blog is to divide it into three main sections: Unreal Engine Game Creation, C++ Life and General, because after all, we come from a background of game software programming, learning C++ and Unreal Engine, and when we first come to an unfamiliar field, we must start with something we are familiar with in order to produce content more easily. Of course, if I find something interesting, it will be added to my blog as a new section. Well, that’s all for now, I’ve got to get busy. If you are interested in me and would like to know more about me, you can check out my profile by clicking on “About XW7\u0026” in the top right corner. I’m sure my profile will continue to be updated, after all, people are growing up, and my experience, abilities and work will get richer and richer as time goes by.
